Thanks for using the JPA archetype quick start.

General
=======

While the Maven archetype process does just about everything for you,
there are a couple of things you need to change:

1) Update your jdbc connection properties:
   src/main/filters/jdbc.properties 

2) When you create a new entity, you will need to list the entity in
   the persistence.xml file, located here:
   src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml 

Database Generation
===================

If you would like hibernate to crate your database for you, use the
-Pdb profile, like this:

mvn process-classes -Pdb 

The above will validate your annotations or O/R mapping files and
display the ddl.  If you would like the above to actually change your
database, use the following:

mvn process-classes -Pdb -Dexport=true

Persistence Explained.  I created this archetype while writing the
book as a way to kick-start the multiple examples I needed.  

Enjoy
